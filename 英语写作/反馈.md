0716

单复数，被动形式，is/are + adv. +  v.ing



0718

serve后直接跟名词

to serve the American People



第三人称

close to her 不是 she



Compared with  不是 compare with，被比较



0720

连接词，使句子更有逻辑。

前面说的是私人 这里是国家了 加一个 Besides （此外）China and India are also... 这样才有逻辑





0722

在现代的短语：

In modern **society/world**（而不是单单用 In modern)



第三人称单数 

That **promotes** the online dating’s development in a certain extent.



用被动态，**Compared** with parents and friends...



0724(无)

0726

一句话要写清楚，

Boris Johnson, Britain's new prime minister, may be Britain's shortest-serving prime minister **if he doesn‘t get Brexit done by Oct 31st.**

"一定要加这个限定条件 不然好像听起来他有别的问题一样"



what's more, Mr. Johnson's cabinet was stuffed with Brexiteers.

写成：

What’s more, **though Mr Johnson's cabinet is full of Brexiteers, he still needs to woo the two very different groups.** 

"要强调一下 虽然议会里很多退欧派 但还是有支持留欧的 所以要平衡"



0728



many 后跟复数

much后跟不可数名词

a lot of/lots of 既可修饰不可数也可修饰可数

disagree/agree with sb. / on sth.

few 表否定，几乎没有（强调少）； a few 表肯定，表有



将动词转为名词和被动态使用

将He suffered underestimated改为：

His suffer is underestimated 这样可以



0730

be going to 即将

will 将来，也可能指很长一段时间

```
Boris Johnson and Trump have a good relationship now, they praised each other in publicly and privately.
```

用in publicly and privately而不是public、private，praise是动词，应该用副词修饰，形容词修饰名词。



there is an expert think  ------->改为 **According to an expert**



... in the issues of ...

"小的东西用in 大的东西用on 这个原则知道了就行 如果你认为是big issues 用on可以的"



0801

我毛毛原话：

```
Finish和end都是终结性动词，可用于现在完成时态，但由于动作是瞬时间完成的所以不能与for或since引出的时间状语连用。你这里虽然没有for 和since引导从句，但隐含的意思就是最近的中美贸易对话已经结束了一段时间，（The latest US-China trade talks have ended for a few months)所以应该用延续性词代替，用be over更好
```



0803

On the other hand, 和on the other side

```
你可以用on the other side 但不能on the other hand 这个词的一次 我也说过很多次了（可能没直接跟你说）就是 on one/the other hand 只有在两件事处于对立面的时候 才能使用 他不是汉语的‘一方面/另一方面’

所以在这里 你这个用不了 你第一件事说川普要加征关税 第二件事说他把原因归结于中国 两件事并不是对立的
```

​      

accused they failing to keep their promises 。不对，应改为：

```
accused that they failed to keep their promises.
```



But his humiliating action also made the fraying relationship **become** weaker.

```
make it do 后跟原型，所以用 become
```

   

， it will strengthen the view of China is not the best base from which to serve the American market.  

```
it will strengthen that China is not the best base to serve the American market 根本不需要from which

什么时候用from? 比如说

I just arrived the workplace, from where I make a living

(‘我’是给公司打工 并不是给工作地点打工 所以from where I make a living 但当代英语为了简化很多东西 其实也可以直接用where了）
```



0805

fault有指责的用法

```
They also faulted Senate Republicans for not passing legislation they said would help prevent mass shootings.
```

购物，shop不是都用shopping

```
In El Paso, Rosie Bridges Farmer, 61, and her family routinely shop at the Walmart  where  the  shooting  took  place,  only  a  one-minute  drive  from their home.
```



”Both of these two shootings' investigating are in early stages. “不对

应改成----->

**Investigation towards the two shootings are on early stage.**





1014

quantum computer that **was** invented recently.

quantum computer invented recently.

```
that was invented 或者 invented 就是不能 that invented
```



ps:关于critical thinking，除了自己的观点，还有应有对反方的思考

```
你的point of view 缺一部分 你只证明了为什么你是对的 却没有讨论你的反面观点到底有什么问题

think about it - 那些支持加密货币的人？他们的理由何在？他们有没有考虑你说的这几个点？你同意还是不同意他们？是怎么个法？这些你都没说

其他的点算是比较清楚了
```



关于**above all**

1018

不能 that whether , 两个引导词同时用



In my opinion，most consumer tech companies can't raise profits to get rid of the deficit through **raising their** prices.

```
through是介词，介词后面跟ing
```



given their promises of **rise** profits have failed every time.



```
Loyalty是名词 ,
Be系动词后面加形容词 loyal，be loyal to 是固定词组
```

 可以用，someone had less loyalty to ...





But when the next recession is coming, people **would---->may/could** spend more time cooking by themselves rather than eating out or spend more money and waiting for a food delivery.

```
这个点可以 但说的时候建议不要用would 用may或者could
```



As the article “The Next Recession Will Destroy Millennials” said, Millennials are already in debt and without savings. After the next downturn, they’ll be in even bigger trouble. And those young people are the primary users of the consumer tech companies.

```
As denoted by the author in the article ‘ The next...' 这样来引 anyway 你知道引用了 well done

而且后面还有一个 你要说出来 年轻人最后完了 退回老年人的生活方式 - 然后呢？然后他们就不用这些新东西了？是因为没钱了？还是因为不接受新鲜事物？你没说明白（我也没看懂 其实）所以是在 young people are the primary users of the consumer tech companies 后面 再继续讲
```



1018

will 后跟动词原形

情态动词后跟原形 need could can may  might must will should



I think the phenomenon of modern-depression is not a bad thing *concerned with* a long-term perspective.（自己的原句）

```
Your argument is clear, which is great. However, the way you present that needs to be reconsidered.

"I think the phenomenon of modern-depression is not a bad thing if revealed from a long-term perspective."
```



1022

```
Capitalism and the Historians

The views generally held about the rise of the factory system in Britain derive from highly distorted accounts of the social consequences of that system—so say the distinguished economic historians whose papers make up this book. The authors offer documentary evidence to support their conclusion that under capitalism the workers, despite long hours and other hardships of factory life, were better off financially, had more opportunities, and led a better life than had been the case before the Industrial Revolution.
```





1024

社会生产力：social productivity

```
你这个 counter的有点过分了 前面一共几句话讲了论据 后面长篇大论的在counter 这说明你一开始的观点站不住脚

你需要调整你的结构 主干论据要占到一半 后面整个critical thinking的部分占三分之一 并且 最后要把你的结论和argument调成相同 不要前面说good for well being 后面说good for wellbeing but need to solve more problems
```
